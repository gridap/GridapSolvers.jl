# GridapSolvers

Documentation for [GridapSolvers](https://github.com/gridap/GridapSolvers.jl).

GridapSolvers provides non-algebraic solvers for the Gridap ecosystem, designed with High Performance Computing (HPC) in mind.

Solvers follow a modular design, where most blocks can be combined to produce PDE-taylored solvers for a wide range of problems.
